<h1>The Best Movies According to Mukta</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Jab we meet</h3>
<p>This movies is the classic must watch, Sunshine girl with a sweet gentalmen guy meet on a train,. All the stars in the sky for this rom-com.</p>
<h3>Always</h3>
<p>I prefer the korean version of this movie , it's more closer to my heart. One of my best comfort movie , a blind girl, who live to her fullest  and an ex-boxer , who's goal is to run away from its past life.</p>
<h3>Me before you</h3>
<p>It's ending really broke my heart and them together was all i needed but alas .This opened a new corner in my mind full of butterflies for small gesters and unrealistic expections for romance. </p>
